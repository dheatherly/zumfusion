This project is for a course assignment. It's to build a bootstrap website that demonstrates the principles learned in the course.  It's a modification of the website that was built during the course and includes many of the same features but implemented with different content and structure.  The emphasis on the coding is on using bootstrap features.  A small amount of javascript is used to control a modal; otherwise, most all the code is bootstrap 4.
