This project is for a final honors course assignment. It was built using bootstrap and contains content about DonamiSports which is a non-profit that helps children of Liberation by giving sports equipment and sports clothing to them.  The site uses many of the principles from the course and has many features in common with the code used to develop a restaurant site for the course.
